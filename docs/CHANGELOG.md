## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-24

The first public release.

### Added
- Repair and maintenance: **Settings > Updates and maintenance** and `dispctrl maintenance repair|clear-cache` put back the sign-in task and Start menu shortcut and clear logs and cached monitor data. The installer offers the same, plus a settings reset that keeps a backup.
- Help > Report a problem and `dispctrl report`: a scrubbed diagnostic report, reviewed before a prefilled issue opens.
- Devices learn each new monitor by themselves; remove one from the list, share one or all.
- Hotkeys show whether each shortcut is working or taken by another program, warn about combinations Windows keeps, and list Windows' own display shortcuts.
- Sponsor entry in the navigation, and contact details on the About page.
- **Stay active**: keeps the screen on and stops the lock screen and chat apps showing you as Away, with a one-pixel pointer nudge after a minute idle. A quick panel tile, a switch under Keep awake, a hotkey action and `dispctrl awake set --stay-active on`.
- The tray icon is drawn bolder while Stay active or Keep awake is on, and can use the Windows accent colour.
- The device library can say what a model's panel is, so built-in laptop panels, which have no DDC/CI, can be described too. A panel the library knows as OLED gets burn-in protection without being marked by hand. `dispctrl devices panel --monitor 1 --technology OLED` sets it; sharing carries it.
- Unison brightness across every display, each inside a calibrated range, with
  the option to replace Windows brightness: the Quick Settings slider and the
  laptop's brightness keys drive every display.
- Hardware brightness over DDC/CI and WMI, and software dimming below the
  hardware minimum.
- Night light per display or in unison, scheduled or following Windows, with an
  optional one-off lift of Windows' gamma limit for warmer and dimmer settings.
- Per-monitor taskbar hiding, per-monitor wallpaper, and a display arrangement
  drawn at physical size.
- Every DDC/CI control a monitor offers, and a device library that learns
  manufacturer-specific codes and shares them as a reviewed GitHub issue.
- Focus mode, OLED care with two-stage idle dimming, keep-awake and dark mode.
- A quick panel on the tray icon, with a simple mode, a lock, and sections that
  can be reordered, folded and hidden.
- Global hotkeys registered by the engine, with a default set.
- `dispctrl.exe`, a console CLI with JSON output covering every option in the app.
- A per-user installer, portable and CLI zips, and an MSIX for the Microsoft
  Store.
